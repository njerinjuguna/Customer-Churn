Customer churn is defined as when customers discontinue doing business with a firm or service.

The telecommunications market is a very competitive one as customers can choose from a variety of service providers and switch from one to the next. For the companies in this industry, customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers.

SyriaTel is a is telecomunications company currently experiencing frequent customer churn, which leads to lost revenue, which in turn affects other business processes within the company. This study analyses SyriaTel's historical data on customer demographics and behavioural patterns to come up with insights that will be actionable striving towards customer retention. 


## Objectives:
1. Finding the distribution of Churn Customers and customers that keep in with the active services.

2. Analysing the data in terms of various features responsible for customer Churn

3. Finding a most suited machine learning model for correct classification of Churn and non churn customers.


The dataset being used in this study is SyriaTel Customer Churn (https://www.kaggle.com/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset)

The stakeholder of this project is the telecommunications company SyriaTel.

This study follows the following steps:
1. Business understanding - This step involves understanding the business problem,defining the stakeholder for the study, defining the problem statement and proposed solution.
2. Data preparation- This involves data cleaning: handling missing values, duplicate values and handling data types of columns to the required ones
3. Exploratory data Analysis - This step involves analysing the data and coming up with visualizations that can aid in making data-driven decisions.
4. Modeling and testing: This covers the development and performance validation of the customers' churn prediction models with various machine learning algorithms
5. Conclusion: Thiis gives a summary of the findings of the study


The algorithms used in this study are: Logistic regression, Decision trees, KNN and Random Forests
